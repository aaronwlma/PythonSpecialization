### Coursework for: Course 03 - Using Python to Access Web Data

The course directory contains assignments required to fulfill the expectations of the third course of University of Michigan's Coursera specialization on Python. Files with the format assignmentXX.py are the Python files that solve the assignment challenge, while the .txt/.xml/.json files in this directory are the supplementary material used in solving the challenge.  For certain assignments, BeautifulSoup was used to parse information from webpages, and so BeautifulSoup has been included in this directory as well.
